                        Hey you scrolled down here, thanks foryour attention, as you know by know I'am a software engeneer here in New York City, but what I want to share with you here is what made me an enthusiast for Technology and what led me to take it as my profession.It started back when I was a kid and had my first computer me and my brother got it from our Father, all I wanted to do is play video games on it because even then I knew it was more powerful than our PS1 console, but as time passed it started to have problems that prevented it from playing video games in a playable framerate, it started stuttering hard every 2 minutes and it stutters for about 15 to 20 seconds. I knew it was something inside that is causing this but i could not open it becausei would be in trouble. one day i was home alone and said this is my chance to open that computer. I opened it and there it was, a big pile of dark dust. i disassembled the components one by one and brushed them with a tooth brush to clean them, except for the CPU I left alone and just brushed its cooler fan. after I closed it and turned it on there was no more Stutters. right then and there i thought to myself "I'm a genius" so I went deep learning about PC components I became able to build a computer so easily and wanted to learn how the CPU and the GPU are made, I learned a little bit about Nvidia Cuda Programing which led me to Web Development and Object Oriented Programing. I started with HTML5 amd CSS3 then Python, JavaScripts, AutoHotkey , Java and then kotlin, in that order, then learned the Spring Framework for Java, and after I became efficient in Kotlin I learned Android development in Android Studio. now I have a couple of programing and scripting languages under my belt.
